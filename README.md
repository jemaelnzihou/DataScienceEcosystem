•	Insert code and markdown cells

•	Share your notebook through GitHub
Instructions

**How to create a new Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:**

1.	Open Jupyter Notebook by either clicking on its icon or typing 'jupyter notebook' in the command line.
   
2.	Once Jupyter is open in your browser, click on the 'New' button on the right side of the screen.
   
3.	From the dropdown menu, select 'Python 3' (or whichever kernel you prefer).
   
4.	A new tab will open with your new notebook. Click on 'Untitled' at the top of the page and rename it to 'DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb'.
   
5.	Press Enter to save the new name.
   
**How to create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook, follow these steps:**

1.	Click on the first cell of your notebook.
   
2.	From the dropdown menu at the top of the page, select 'Markdown'.
   
3.	In the markdown cell, type '# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem' to create a H1 style heading.
   
4.	Press Shift + Enter to render the markdown cell.
    
 **To share your Jupyter notebook through GitHub, follow these steps:**

 **Step 1:** Create a GitHub Account
If you haven't already, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

 **Step 2:** Create a New Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
   
2. Click on the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
   
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., `DataScienceEcosystem`).
   
5. Add a description if you want.
   
6. Choose **Public** as the repository visibility.
   
7. Click **Create repository**.

 **Step 3:** Upload Your Jupyter Notebook
 
1. Once your repository is created, you'll see an option to **Upload files**.
   
2. Click on **Upload files**.
   
3. Drag and drop your Jupyter notebook file (`DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`) or click **choose your files** to select it.
   
4. Once the file is uploaded, scroll down and click on **Commit changes**.

 **Step 4:** Get the Repository Link

1. After committing your changes, you will be redirected to the repository page.
   
2. Copy the URL from the address bar (it should look something like `https://github.com/yourusername/DataScienceEcosystem`).

**Step 5:** Submit the Link

Make sure to keep this link handy for your assignment submission.

 **Additional Tips**
- Ensure that your notebook is well-documented with markdown cells for better readability.
- You can also add a README file to your repository to explain the project further if required. 

If you need any specific guidance or run into issues while uploading, feel free to ask!
