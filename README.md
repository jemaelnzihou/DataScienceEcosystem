Objective
In this final assignment, you will:

•	Create a Jupyter Notebook

•	Insert code and markdown cells

•	Share your notebook through GitHub
Instructions

Tools to Data Science Module 6 

•	Exercise 1:
To create a new Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:
1.	Open Jupyter Notebook by either clicking on its icon or typing 'jupyter notebook' in the command line.
2.	Once Jupyter is open in your browser, click on the 'New' button on the right side of the screen.
3.	From the dropdown menu, select 'Python 3' (or whichever kernel you prefer).
4.	A new tab will open with your new notebook. Click on 'Untitled' at the top of the page and rename it to 'DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb'.
5.	Press Enter to save the new name.
   
Exercise 2:
To create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook, follow these steps:
7.	Click on the first cell of your notebook.
8.	From the dropdown menu at the top of the page, select 'Markdown'.
9.	In the markdown cell, type '# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem' to create a H1 style heading.
10.	Press Shift + Enter to render the markdown cell.
To take a screenshot of the markdown cell:
11.	Make sure the markdown cell with the title is visible on your screen.
12.	Use your computer's screenshot function to capture the image. On most computers, this is done by pressing the 'PrtSc' or 'Print Screen' button.
13.	Open an image editing program (like Paint or Photoshop) and paste the screenshot.
14.	Save the image as '2-title.png'.
 
For math expressions:
If the math expression does not have any preceding or succeeding text, write it between triple caret symbols ($$). For example:
x=y+z
If the math expression is inline with other text, write it between single dollar signs ($). For example:
The sum of y and z is x.
For coding snippets:
If the programming language is known, write the code block between triple backticks and specify the language. For example:
python
print("Hello, world!")
If the programming language is not known, write the code block between triple backticks without specifying the language. For example:
print("Hello, world!")
For dollar amounts:
Write the dollar sign followed by the amount. For example:
$50.

**How To Create a markdown cell**

**STEP 1:**
Click on code and you will see a list of options.
 
**STEP 2:**
Click on Markdown from the list.
 Now the following cell has been converted into markdown.
 
ALSO KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS CAN BE USED TO CREATE A CELL OR MARKDOWN.
To get your shortcuts recognized you first need to press Esc key.
After that click 'B'. Notice that a cell is added.
 Now press 'M'. Notice that cell changes to a markdown. Also you notice that it changes from code to markdown in upper box.
 Now when you type '#' in markdown it becomes a heading. Multiple '#' can be typed. Look image for better understanding.
 Now lets fill the requirements.
Write your name in level 3 heading.
For a bullet list to appear, add " * " sign before sentence.
To make a text bold you need to add " ** ", before and after the text.
To make a text italic you need to add " * " before and after the text.
For creating a link follow this syntax: [ TEXT ]( LINK )
So your markdown will look as shown in image before executing cell.
 After executing you see following:
 
 **To share your Jupyter notebook through GitHub, follow these steps:**

 **Step 1:** Create a GitHub Account
If you haven't already, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

 **Step 2:** Create a New Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., `DataScienceEcosystem`).
4. Add a description if you want.
5. Choose **Public** as the repository visibility.
6. Click **Create repository**.

 **Step 3:** Upload Your Jupyter Notebook
1. Once your repository is created, you'll see an option to **Upload files**.
2. Click on **Upload files**.
3. Drag and drop your Jupyter notebook file (`DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`) or click **choose your files** to select it.
4. Once the file is uploaded, scroll down and click on **Commit changes**.

 **Step 4:** Get the Repository Link
1. After committing your changes, you will be redirected to the repository page.
2. Copy the URL from the address bar (it should look something like `https://github.com/yourusername/DataScienceEcosystem`).

**Step 5:** Submit the Link
Make sure to keep this link handy for your assignment submission.

 **Additional Tips**
- Ensure that your notebook is well-documented with markdown cells for better readability.
- You can also add a README file to your repository to explain the project further if required. 

If you need any specific guidance or run into issues while uploading, feel free to ask!
